# Contributing to hata repository

We would love your input! This open source repository is open to new ideas and improvements from anyone.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issues, discussions or via
chat in our Discord server.

Note that contributions may not be accepted immediately on the basis of a contributor failing to follow these
guidelines.

## Your code changes should happen through pull requests

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. **No force-pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.

2. If PRing from your own fork, **ensure that "Allow edits from maintainers" is checked**. This gives permission for 
    maintainers to commit changes directly to your fork, speeding up the review process.

3. **Adhere to the prevailing code style**

    We do not use flake8, or other predefined styles, but please try to stick yourself to the currently used one.
    
    Some minor things you might notice:
    
    - Codebase uses single quotes `'` for strings.
    - The preferred line length is 120 characters.
    - Descriptive names are preferred even if they are longer.
    - Docstrings are numpy-like, but unique to hata.

## Report bugs using GitHub's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by
[opening a new issue](https://github.com/HuyaneMatsu/hata/issues)

When creating a new issue, please follow our templates if possible.

In general **Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Discuss features using GitHub's discussions
Have a new idea? Want to discuss existing one? Please open an issue, or use
[discussions](https://github.com/HuyaneMatsu/hata/discussions)

When opening discussion make sure you go into details and give as much info as you can.

For example:
- A quick summary (what's it for, what would it do)
- Reason for having this
- Approximate things that would need to be added/changed (if lot make a todo list)
- Possibly some short example code
