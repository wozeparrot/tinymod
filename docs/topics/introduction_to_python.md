# Introduction

If you are reading this, you probably want to create Discord bots! They are cool and flashy, but creating them might
not be that simple. Many people start programming with creating a Discord bot, tho creating a decent one requires
intermediate programming knowledge. If you already know a language, which is not python, you should consider using a
library for that language instead. It would prevent frustration when learning, reading the documentation or
understanding the offered help - it is a great idea to have solid knowledge.

What is hata? It is an asynchronous Discord API wrapper built on top of scarletio. It is designed to be easy to use,
with also providing rich API offering everything what an advanced developer might need.

In these guides you will learn about various concepts:

- How to get a bot up and running from scratch.
- How to keep your code organized.
- Learn about best practices.
- More advanced concepts.
- And much more.
